[] Better script for the turns. Should allow to rearrange actions from mistakes etc..
[] Code to load cards from excel
[O] Somehow to design an event system. Possibly function that will be appended in a deque and they will execute
[X] Find a way to handle abilities
[X] Start and end of turn effects



Abilities
- Abilities that trigger at a specific point in the turn (Start of turn , end of turn ...)
- Abilities that triggers immediately when a card is played
- Abilities that triggers every round till they are removed
- Abilities that change the rules of the game

Thoughts

[X] I think that abilityEffectType Should split to AbilityEffectType and AbilityEffectTime
  The type of the ability Immediate or Permanent and when is triggered in the game?
